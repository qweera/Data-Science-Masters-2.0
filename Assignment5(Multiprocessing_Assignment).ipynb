    "Ans 1. Multiprocessing in Python is a technique used to execute multiple processes concurrently or running multiple processes simultaneously within a single thread, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores to perform tasks in parallel and hereby improving the performance of a program by using multiple CPUs or CPU cores. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for CPU-bound tasks. Python's multiprocessing module makes it relatively easy to work with multiple processes"

    "Ans 2. **Core Concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: In multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process. All threads share the same memory space of the parent process, which means they can easily communicate and share data but also need to be careful about synchronization to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own separate memory space. Processes are more isolated from each other and communicate using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like queues or pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, multithreading is generally not well-suited for CPU-bound tasks that require intense computation. However, it can be useful for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend a lot of time waiting, such as web scraping or network requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks since each process runs in its own interpreter and has its own GIL. This allows multiple CPU cores to be fully utilized, resulting in better performance for CPU-intensive tasks"
